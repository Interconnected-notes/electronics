Some QFP packages have an exposed pad. The exposed pad is an extra pad underneath or on top of the QFP that may act as a ground connection and/or as a heat sink for the package.

These type of QFP packages often have a **-EP** suffix (e.g. a LQFP-EP 64), or they have an odd number of leads, (e.g. a TQFP-101).
