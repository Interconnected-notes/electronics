> [!abstract] Main point
> The study of electronics is essentially the study of how charges move around in a system, and just as the first step in solving any kinematics problem is to look at the forces on each object, a useful step in electronics is to think about the forces on those charges. Those forces are just the (negative) gradient of the voltage.

In electronics, forces on charges lead to acceleration and velocities of those charges, which are described by currents. An [[Current|electric current]] is just a particular way of describing the average flow rate of electric charges, as covered in Electrons in Motion.
