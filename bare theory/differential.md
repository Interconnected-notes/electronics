The 
\[d\] in 
\[{dq}/{dt}\] is notation from calculus, it means differential.
You can think of 
\[d\] as meaning "a tiny change in ..."
For example, the expression 
\[dt\] means a tiny change in time. When you see 
\[d\] in a ratio, like 
\[dq/dt\], it means, "a tiny change in 
\[q\] (charge) for each tiny change in 
\[t\] (time)." An expression like 
\[dq/dt\] is called a derivative, and it is what you study in Differential Calculus.
In calculus, 
\[d\] represents a tiny amount of change, so small it becomes "infinitesimally small". That is, it goes to zero. A little farther down in this article you will see change indicated with a 
\[\Delta\] symbol, as in 
\[\Delta h\] is a change of height. We use 
\[\Delta\] to indicate a large finite change, like 
\[1\] meter or 
\[1\] second. And we use 
\[d\] to indicate tiny zero-sized change.
