**Maintained** switches -- stay in one state until actuated into a new one, and then remain in that state until acted upon once again. These switches might also be called **toggle** or **ON/OFF** switches.

**Momentary** switches only remain active as long as they’re actuated. If they're not being actuated, they remain in their “off” state. You’ve probably got a momentary switch (or 50) right in front of you...keys on a keyboard!
