The NE555 takes 10mA from the supply when the output is “high”, and 1mA when the output is “low”
- **VCC**—the supply voltage: 4.5V to 16V
- Can output up to 200 mA of current (IO)
- The oscillator does not change frequency even VCC changes.

### 555 timer applications
- Pulse generation
- Time delay generation
- Sequential timing
- Precision timing
- Pulse width modulation
- Pulse position modulation
- Linear ramp generator
