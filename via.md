Essentially a via is a small drilled hole that goes through two or more adjacent layers; the hole is plated with metal (often copper) that forms an electrical connection through the insulating layers.

# A via consists of:

1. Barrel — conductive tube filling the drilled hole
2. Pad — connects each end of the barrel to the component, plane, or trace
3. Antipad — clearance hole between barrel and metal layer to which it is not connected
