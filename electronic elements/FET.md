> [!abstract] Main point
> Field-Effect Transistor - transistor in which the voltage on one terminal (the gate) creates a field that allows or disallows conduction between the other two terminals (the source and drain).

Was invented in **1947** at Bell Labs by Michael John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley.

The FET is one of two major kinds of [[Transistor]], the other being the [[Bipolar Junction Transistor]].
