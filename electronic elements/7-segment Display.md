# Driving
**7-segment Displays** are usually driven by a special type of integrated circuit (IC) commonly known as a 7-segment decoder/driver, such as the CMOS 4511 or TTL 7447

This driver also called Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)

Today, LED based 7-segment displays have been largely replaced by _liquid crystal displays_ (LCDs) which consume less current.
